**A**is **I**s **S**cript  
that I'm personally using to install ArchLinux quickly.

I know there already exists arch-install.  
But I do not need/require that much features on my own install process.

I'm currently planning to expand these scripts,  
so that other users can also modify and use these scripts to install Arch.
